Santa’s Magic Word Workshop — Anagram Groups
Story

Santa’s elves are preparing Christmas decorations, but their magic word machine has scrambled the letters of many festive words! Your job is to help Santa group together all the words that are made of the same letters — only rearranged differently.

Each group represents one magical decoration pattern.

Task

Write a function that groups together all Christmas word anagrams.

Two words belong in the same group if:

They contain exactly the same letters
The order of letters may differ
Input

An array of scrambled Christmas-related words:

["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]

Output

Return an array of grouped anagram words:

[
  ["eat", "tea", "ate"],
  ["tan", "nat"],
  ["bat"]
]
Each inner array represents one anagram family created by the elves.

Bonus (Optional for Extra Elf Points)

Sort each group alphabetically
Sort all groups by group size (largest first)
Rules

Do not use built-in anagram check libraries
The solution should be efficient for large word lists
