Santa’s Midnight Clock Countdown


Santa’s magical workshop clock shows x hours and y minutes.
Write a program that calculates:


m — how many minutes have passed since midnight
s — how many seconds have passed since midnight


Example:
If x = 3 and y = 5:
Minutes passed: m = 185
Seconds passed: s = 11100
